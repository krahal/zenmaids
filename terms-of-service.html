                    <h1>Zen Maids Terms & Conditions</h1>
                    <p>By using this website to book service, you agree to comply with these terms & conditions. If you
                        do not agree to these
                        terms & conditions, do not book service with us.</p>
                    <h1>Booking Confirmation</h1>
                    <p>Booking service online doesn't guarantee you a spot for that date/time, you will be contacted by
                        email or phone with a
                        confirmation.</p>
                    <h1>Cleaning Crew</h1>
                    <p>We always work with teams of two, occasionally more cleaners may be needed due to the complexity
                        of work or busy
                        schedule. We do our best to limit the rotation of cleaners in your home while still providing
                        sufficient cross-training
                        to our cleaning technicians.
                        Our employees have been rigorously background screened & drug tested prior to working with us,
                        you can rest assured all
                        our staff has integrity and is held accountable.</p>
                    <h1>Right to Refuse Service</h1>
                    <p>We reserve the right to deny &/or terminate service because of safety concerns, inappropriate or
                        uncomfortable
                        situations, weapons on-premises, severe clutter & disconnected utilities.
                        Our employees have the choice to leave if the home is in an extremely unsanitary condition or
                        they feel
                        unsafe/threatened. If you book a cleaning that is unreasonable, the cleaners may refuse service
                        on the spot & you will
                        be charged the cancellation fee.</p>
                    <h1>Cleaning Day Preparation</h1>
                    <p>Your price for cleaning is based on the cleaners focusing all of their time on cleaning, we ask
                        that you take a few
                        minutes to tidy up to allow the cleaners easy access to the areas/surfaces to be cleaned:
                        floors, counter-tops,

                        lower frequency</p>
